USING-DENTAL-METRICS-TO-PREDICT-GENDER

The aim of this project is to analyze dental data to predict an individual's gender based on specific dental features. This endeavor integrates the fields of dentistry, data science, and machine learning to explore the correlations between dental characteristics and gender, ultimately developing a predictive model. Introduction and Background Dental anthropology has long studied the relationship between dental features and various demographic factors, including gender. Previous research indicates that certain dental characteristics, such as tooth size, shape, and wear patterns, exhibit sexually dimorphic traits. Leveraging these insights, this project seeks to apply modern data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict gender from dental features with high accuracy.

Data Collection and Preprocessing The initial phase of the project involves the collection of a comprehensive dataset containing dental records. These records include measurements of teeth dimensions, morphology, dental arch form, and other relevant features. The dataset also contains the gender of the individuals, serving as the target variable for the predictive model.

Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset. This process includes:

 Data Preprocessing: Identify and handle missing values, Encoding categorical data,Split independent and dependent variables, Normalize the X variable ,    
 Exploratory Data Analysis  ,
 Model Building   ,
 Evaluation
